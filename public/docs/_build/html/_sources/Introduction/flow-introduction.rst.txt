FlOWS Introduction
=====================================

A Flow is an abstract data type that provides a structured approach for modeling and managing interactions between multiple agents. It encompasses various elements, such as storing relevant information, maintaining conversation history, and facilitating a seamless exchange of messages. A Flow is designed to offer a clean and efficient way of describing and orchestrating interactions between agents.

Purpose of the FLOWS
======================
The primary purpose of a Flow is to provide a framework for managing complex multi-agent conversations. It serves as a container for storing and organizing relevant data, including the state of the conversation, user inputs, intermediate solutions, and any other contextual information necessary for maintaining coherent and meaningful interactions to solve a plethora of tasks.

Flow enables the coordination and synchronization of multiple agents within a conversation, allowing them to share information, make decisions, and generate appropriate responses. It provides a high-level abstraction that simplifies the development and maintenance of conversational systems by encapsulating the complexities of multi-agent interactions.


Key Components
===============

1. **State**  
The state is a critical component of a Flow. It represents the current state of the conversation and holds relevant information that agents can receive and then manipulate. The state can include various attributes, such as user preferences, dialogue history, session context, and any other data that is necessary for the agents to process and generate responses effectively.  
The state evolves as the conversation progresses, with new information being added or modified based on user inputs and agent responses. Agents can read from and write to the state, enabling them to maintain context and make informed decisions during the conversation.

2. **Agents**    
Agents are the participants in a conversation within a Flow. They can be implemented as separate software components, each responsible for specific tasks or areas of expertise. For example, in a customer support scenario, there might be separate agents for handling billing inquiries, technical support, or general inquiries.  
Agents can have different capabilities and roles within the conversation. They receive inputs from the user and other agents, process the information, and generate appropriate responses based on their expertise. Agents can also query and modify the state, allowing them to access and update the conversation context as needed.

3. **Interaction Management**  
Flow provides mechanisms for managing the interaction between agents. It facilitates the exchange of messages among agents, allowing them to communicate, collaborate, and respond to user inputs in a coordinated manner.  
Flow ensures that agents receive the relevant parts of the conversation history, enabling them to understand the context and provide coherent responses. It manages the sequencing of agent turns, ensuring that the conversation flows smoothly and agents take turns appropriately. Flow also handles any necessary routing of messages between agents, based on predefined rules or logic.

4. **Message History**   
A Flow maintains a record of the conversation history, which includes the sequence of user inputs, agent responses, and any other relevant events. This chat history can be used for various purposes, such as debugging, analysis, training, or generating summaries of the conversation.  
The chat history serves as a valuable resource for monitoring and evaluating the performance of agents. It enables developers to review the interactions and identify areas for improvement, detect errors or inconsistencies, and gain insights into user behavior and preferences.
